# Adobe 2D shapes Symmtery Detection (Horizontal, Vertical, Diagonal)

This Python file incorporates code designed to identify and quantify distinct shapes within an image. Subsequently, it determines the presence of horizontal, vertical, and diagonal lines of symmetry for these shapes. The script utilizes test images as a benchmark, and the corresponding results are included as well.
